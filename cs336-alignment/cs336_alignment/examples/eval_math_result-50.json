If he maintains his speed, what is the distance covered by him in 2 seconds? The options are: A) 1/12 meters, B) 100 meters, C) 1/7 meters, D) 50/3 meters. To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance Roshan covers in 2 seconds given that he walks 50 meters in one minute.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how fast Roshan walks in meters per second.\n2. Since Roshan walks 50 meters in one minute (60 seconds), his speed in meters per second is \\( \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\) meters per second.\n3. Next, we need to find the distance he covers in 2 seconds. Since his speed is \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) meters per second, in 2 seconds he will cover \\( 2 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) meters.\n\nSo, the distance covered in 2 seconds is \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) meters, which corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code:\n```python\n# Given values\ndistance_in_meters_per_minute = 50\ntime_in_seconds = 2\n\n# Convert the speed from meters per minute to meters",

The park management decides to mark a special path within the park such that the note of the sign \"Path of Wisdom\" is equal to the square of the distance from the center of the park to any point on the path. If the path is a perfect circle, what is the radius of this path, given that the note on the path is 1600 square meters? To determine the radius of the path, we start by understanding the given information and the relationship between the note on the path and the distance from the center of the park to any point on the path.\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The note on the path is equal to the square of the distance from the center of the park to any point on the path.\n   - The note on the path is 1600 square meters.\n\n2. **Define the variables:**\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the radius of the path.\n   - The distance from the center of the park to any point on the path is \\( r \\).\n   - Therefore, the note on the path is \\( r^2 \\).\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   \\[\n   r^2 = 1600\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( r \\):**\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{1600}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r = 40\n   \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the path is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) meters.\n\nA middle school math club is investigating the properties of a special sequence of numbers generated by the function $G(n)$, where $G(n) = 2p",

Note that while the number of members in the band is not more than 100, if $m=7$, then $r=22$ so that the number of members reaches $7 \\cdot 22 + 2 =158$, which clearly exceeds the restriction of 100 players.So among the possible solutions, the only restrictions are from $m$ and $r$ having to be integers, and the number of soldiers staying under 100. The highest possible number of members will come from $m=6$ and $r=16$, in which case the number of members is\n\\[mr + 2 = 6 \\cdot 16 + 2 = 98.\\]But $98$ is less than the specified $100$, so the band could have exactly $98$ members. We see this is the only possibility that works.  The largest number of members the band could have is therefore 98. Thus, the answer is $98$.\nThe answer is: $98$",
