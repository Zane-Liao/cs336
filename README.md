# CS336 Spring 2025

- This repository is a collection of all assignments, 
and I am currently completing it

**The Transformer architecture We need to implement**
![Decoder](Transformer.png)

- This is my first time writing deep learning homework related to pytorch. 
I have only written traditional machine learning algorithms and theories
implemented in R language or numpy before, so I often get stuck when coding.
At this time, I often refer to other solutions. I don’t recommend
people like me who don’t have some NLP foundation to complete
these homeworks, because you will encounter many problems 
that you are at a loss, and it is difficult to debug errors.

- My coding time frame is the same as the Stanford deadline.
Considering that they have a good foundation and the help of the
teaching assistant, it should not be a big problem to complete it
within the deadline. If you want to go into the details of all the
components you wrote, please set aside enough time (lol: at least a month)

- I learned a lot in this class. It was hard, but worth it.
Thanks again to Stanford University for its selfless dedication
to facilitating off-campus learners like you and me.
