    "reference": "In order for the piecewise function to be continuous, the function values must be the same at the boundaries of the domains, where the piecewise pieces meet. \nFirst we look at the case where $x>2$. The function is $f(x) = ax+3$. When $x=2$, we have $f(2) = 2a+3$. \n\nThen for the case where $-2 \\le x \\le 2$, the function is $f(x) = x-5$. So when $x=2$, we have $f(2) = 2-5 = -3$. For the function to be continuous, $2a+3$ must be equal to $-3$. Solving $2a+3 = -3$ gives $2a = -6$ or $a = -3$.\n\nNext we consider the case where $x<-2$. The function is $f(x) = 2x-b$. When $x=-2$, we have $f(-2) = -4-b$.\n\nOn the other hand, the function is also $f(x) = x-5$ for $x \\le 2$. So when $x=-2$, we have $f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7$. Again, to ensure continuity, $-4-b$ must be equal to $-7$. Solving $-4 - b = -7$ gives $b = 3$.\n\nFinally, to find $a+b$, we substitute in $a=-3$ and $b=3$, and we find that $a+b = -3 + 3 = 0$. Thus, the value of $a+b$ is 0.\nThe value of $a$ and $b$ are determined so that the function values are the same at the boundaries. The piecewise function is continuous if $a = -3$ and $b = 3$. The sum $a + b$ equals to $\\boxed{0}$ in this case.\nThe answer is: $0$",

    "reference": "For a function to be continuous at a point, the value of the function just to the left of that point must equal the value of the function just to the right of that point.
